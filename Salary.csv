49,XcelaStream,$130K (Employer est.),SENIOR LINUX SOFTWARE SYSTEM ENGINEER,"Manassas, VA","XcelaStream, Inc. (XCS) has developed a multi-patented technology platform that optimizes personal cloud computing. The startup was formed in 2019 as a spin-out from NCS Technologies, Inc., to further develop and commercialize its cutting-edge product. Founded in 1996, NCS is a systems integrator and manufacturer of specialized computing and storage devices.
Our patented technologies will enable a low-latency, high-frame rate, high-resolution, and full-featured user experience on the simplest end-user devices. The solution’s downstream financial impact is massive as it can enable the use of the low-cost “zero client” computers (such as the Raspberry Pi 4) with the equivalent quality and functionality of a high-end, Windows-based “thick client”.
With the continued support of NCS and future institutional investors, we will build a world-class technical team, working with an array of innovative technologies involving FPGA, GPU, AI, virtualization, cloud/edge computing, 5G, and video codecs. This is an exciting opportunity to become an early and valued contributor to the team, tackling unique challenges within the personal cloud computing world. Therein, you get the best of both worlds - the potential upside of a high-flying, 1st mover startup combined with the backing of an established company.
